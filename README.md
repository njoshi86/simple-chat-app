# Thanks to Cory House and react-slingshot (`git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot.git`) for this awesome starter code!

1. **Setup App**

1. User Name and Login Time is stored in store right now. This can be moved to local storage for better experience if we want to handle it on Front End.
2. "Online For" feature only works in Chrome. Moment library has some bug on Safari and FF as per (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11253351/javascript-date-object-issue-in-safari-and-ie).
